# TreeAlgorithms

Different algorithms to traverse/modify binary tree data structures in Python.

#### Depth-first search
Iterating through a binary tree using the different depth-first traversal techniques:
- Pre-order traversal
- In-order traversal
- Post-order traversal

#### Breadth-first search
Iterating through a binary tree using breadth-first search

#### Binary search tree traversal/modification
- Searching
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Verification (cycle detection, node value verification)
